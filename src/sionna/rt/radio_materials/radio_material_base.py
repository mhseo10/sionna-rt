        Samples the radio material

        This function samples an interaction type (e.g., specular reflection,
        diffuse reflection, refraction, or diffraction) and direction of
        propagation for the scattered ray, and returns the corresponding radio
        material sample and Jones matrix. The returned radio material sample
        stores the sampled type of interaction, sampled direction of
        propagation of the scattered ray, and the probability that the selected
        interaction was sampled.

        The following assumptions are made on the inputs:

        - ``ctx.component`` is a binary mask that specifies the types of interaction enabled. Booleans can be obtained from this mask as follows:

        .. code-block:: python

            specular_reflection_enabled = (ctx.component & InteractionType.SPECULAR) > 0
            diffuse_reflection_enabled = (ctx.component & InteractionType.DIFFUSE) > 0
            refraction_enabled = (ctx.component & InteractionType.REFRACTION) > 0
            diffraction_enabled = (ctx.component & InteractionType.DIFFRACTION) > 0

        - ``si.wi`` is the direction of propagation of the incident wave in
          the local frame
        - ``si.sh_frame`` is the surface frame where ``sh_frame.n`` is the normal to
          the intersected surface in the world coordinate system
        - ``si.dn_du`` stores the edge vector in the local frame.
          This is only used for diffraction.
        - ``si.dn_dv`` stores the normal to the n-face in the local frame.
          This is only used for diffraction.
        - ``si.dp_du`` stores the distance from the diffraction point to the source,
          the distance from the diffraction point to the receiver, and the flags indicating
          the enabled interaction types. The first two components are only used when
          diffraction is sampled.
        - ``si.duv_dx`` and ``si.duv_dy`` stores the incident field
        - ``si.t`` stores the solid angle of the incident ray tube.

        Note that all quantities related to diffraction are integrated to the paths only
        if diffraction is sampled.

        The outputs are set as follows:

        - ``bs.wo`` is the direction of propagation of the sampled scattered ray in
          the world frame
        - ``bs.sampled_component`` is the sampled interaction type
        - ``bs.pdf`` is the probability of the sampled interaction type
        - ``jones_mat`` is the Jones matrix describing the transformation incurred
          to the incident wave in the implicit world frame

        :param sample2: A uniformly distributed sample on :math:`[0,1]^2` used to sample the direction of the reflected wave in the case of diffuse reflection, or the direction of the diffracted ray on the Keller cone
